#Project description

You can find a dataset of patients treated in a cardiology department here. Your task in this project is to build a logistic regression model to predict wether a patient takes part in the rehabilitation program or not. Divide your dataset appropriately to train and test dataset and check the performance of your model. Alongside your code you need to submit a detailed report describing the following points:

- introduction (problem statement)

- descriptive analysis of the data

- short explanation on what the data is about and how you are planning to use it in doing the task of the project 

- what are the steps you are taking in order to perform the task and optimising your model (include screen shots whenever needed)

- interpreting the output

- describe the performance of your model, how efficient is it?

- conclusion.
