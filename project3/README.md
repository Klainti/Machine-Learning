# Project description

Movies to be displayed - A hit or a miss?

In this project you are building a model to predict the success or the failure of movie which is about to be released. The predictive models of this project should be built based on at least 4 of the following features:

    Genre,
    MPAA Ratings,
    Movie Length,
    Release Date,
    Actors,
    Directors, and
    Writers
    etc.

You need to make two different predictive models out of four following suggested methods:

    Linear Regression
    Naive Bayes
    Logistic regression 
    SVM

Data Acquisition:

The data should be acquired online through the website https://www.omdbapi.com/.  A list of movies can be scrapped from IMDB. Use the data for the movies 2006-2016. Use the data for year 2017 as test data to validate your model.

 

Project submission:

As your final project you need to submit a written manuscript (max 5 pages) alongside your code. You should also attach a documentation on how your code should be run (what packages, toolboxes, etc. to use). The manuscript should include the following sections:

 

Motivation and Goal. An introduction to the topic area and the goal of the project

Approach. Description on how you are planning to approach the problem and what approaches/models you are going to use to answer the questions.

Discussion. A comparison between the models you built and the prediction power. Explain the difficulties you faced in the modelling phase and how you overcame them and discuss the significance of your findings.
